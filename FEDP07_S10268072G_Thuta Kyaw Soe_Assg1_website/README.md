# FED_Assignment1 
This is my FED Assignment 1 project on the One Direction Website.

The intended audience for this project is to all One Direction fans who are passionate about the band's music and want to book shows to hear them perform live. It is also for people who want to collect memorabillia as there is a One Direction Store in the website. The fans can watch the music videos, listen to music and explore things related to One Direction in this website. This website is also catered to the newer generation who want to discover more about the history, albums and music. I used the 'Inter' font for this website.
